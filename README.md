# Datapak CLI: A command-line interface for creating, packaging, modifying and extracting .datapak files
Datapak CLI is a tool for building and editing Datapaks, a simple to use file compression format that can be intergrated into C++ with the library here: `https://github.com/stelleron/datapak`. 

## Setup
Download the source file from the GitHub repository. The Datapak CLI already comes packaged with all dependencies - you just have to build it on your native platform. The Datapak CLI is also included with a premake5.lua file to build it, as well as the Makefiles.

If you wish to use the Makefiles, just install GNU Make on your computer.  Then, use the terminal to open the project directory and simply just type `make`.

For using the premake5.lua version, download Premake from [here](https://premake.github.io/) and follow setup instructions. Then, use Premake to generate whatever project type you wish using `premake5 (enter your build type here)` and build the project.
